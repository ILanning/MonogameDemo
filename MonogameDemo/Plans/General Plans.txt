(I generally keep a few text files in the project/Git repository to store ideas, psudocode, and future plans)

Basics:
-Load an image file
-Draw image on screen  
-Only draw a section of the image
-Make the image move on the screen
  -Vector2 tracking the object's position
  -Seperate vector in Update function tracking this frame's movement
  -if(press up arrow) movement.Y++;
  -if(press down arrow) movement.Y--;
  -etc.
  -movement.Normalize()
    -Ensures that the movement vector is one unit long, no matter what
-Draw a map
